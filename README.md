## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository and inspect the code.

### Getting started

#### Installation

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/thebiltheory/frontend-nanodegree-mobile-portfolio.git web-optimization
  $ cd web-optimization
  $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080

#### Install your remote Server
1. Install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to the top-level of your project directory to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $ npm install -g ngrok
  $ ngrok http 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights!
 - Should be something like " https://xxxxxxxxx.ngrok.io"

We didn't cover the Navigation Timing API in the first two lessons but it's an incredibly useful tool for automated page profiling. I highly recommend reading.
